## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** NextJs, React, Tailwind, Firebase, Recoil

Insta-like site allows users to sign-in with Google, post photos with captions, comment and like other users posts

Features:

- custom Next Auth login page
- Firebase: Firestore database, Storage and Auth
- Recoil global state managemnt
- Fake users generated using FakerJs
- responsive styles using Tailwind
- Headless UI dialog component
- react-moment library for 'fromNow' timestamps

## Optimizations

The app only covers basic opperations (auth with Google, uploading posts, comments, likes) potential to add full search, components to view more comments, full profile page, alternative sign up methods etc...

## Lessons Learned / Demonstrations of:

- Tailwind with plugins implementation
- Next Auth
- Firebase v9 modules
